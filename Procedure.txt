Mercedes-Benz-Greener-Manufacturing

We are required to reduce the time that cars spend on the test bench. We will work with a dataset representing different permutations of features in a Mercedes-Benz car to predict the time it takes to pass testing. Optimal algorithms will contribute to faster testing, resulting in lower carbon dioxide emissions without reducing Daimlerâ€™s standards.

Step1: Import the required libraries

Step2: Read the data from train.csv

Step3: Collect the Y values into an array

Step4: Checking distribution of labels

Step5: Understand the data types we have

Step6: Count the data in each of the columns

Step7: Read the test.csv data

Step8: Check for null and unique values for test and train sets

Step9: If for any column(s), the variance is equal to zero,then you need to remove those variable(s)

Step10: Apply label encoder

Step11: Make sure the data is now changed into numericals

Step12: Perform dimensionality reduction

Step13: Training using xgboost

Step14: Predict your test_df values using xgboost
